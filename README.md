# Content-Slider
*Initally coded in August, 2020.*

This project was done as a part of the course: https://www.eduonix.com/courses/Web-Development/Learn-Projects-In-JavaScript-And-JQuery

I use a JQuery file from googleapis.com to create a simple timed Photo Content Slider. Sample data and text was used for display.
